To run the Project: 
1. Clone the Project
2. cd to jhdf folder
3. Run ./gradlew.bat build -x test (This will build the project and ignore the test cases. 
The project can not be built with the test cases because some of the test cases are failing, cause the build to be unsucessful.)

To run the test cases, open the jhdf folder inside IntelliJ and run test cases normally.
